Algorithms & data Structures.Graph Algorithms in Java            
This project provides implementations of graph data structures            
Algorithms: BreadthFirstSearch & DijkstraSearch        
Structure          
WeightedGraph<V> – directed/undirected weighted graph.            
Vertex<V> – graph node with weighted edges.        
Search<V> – base class for search algorithms.        
BreadthFirstSearch<V> – BFS for path finding.          
DijkstraSearch<V> – shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.          
GraphTest – demo and test class with example data.          

              
How to Run:                
Just run the GraphTest class and see the result
